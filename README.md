# README

* Ruby/Rails versions are defined in the Gemfile(Gemfile.lock contains the exact Rails version)

* Uses postgres(probably works with anything 9+)

* Dependencies(yarn, node) should be listed here along with getting start instructions(no SQLite needed) https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-a-new-rails-project-installing-rails

* Gems should be installed via `bundle install`
